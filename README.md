This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating through an array. The error occurs because the loop condition `i <= arr.length` attempts to access an element beyond the array's valid index range, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The solution shows how to correct the loop condition to avoid this exception.
